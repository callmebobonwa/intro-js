                <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p>

                            <p>JavaScript is commonly used to make web pages dynamic. As a client scripting language, it provides websites with interactivity like prompts and alerts and it can add animations to images and text.It’s used by websites for the purposes of data validation to ensure that users enter the correct information into fields on contact and sign-up forms. </p>

                            <p>JavaScript is also commonly used for building web applications without web contexts. Rather than sending messages via servers, JavaScript interacts with browsers directly, which enables developers to build fast web apps.  </p>

                            <p>When used in combination with the Node JS framework, JavaScript can be used to create web servers. Because Node JS is event-driven, it moves to the next task quickly without transferring huge amounts of data, which makes JavaScript web servers very fast.JavaScript servers make it easy for developers to handle concurrency and identify errors that may otherwise be difficult to spot in multithreaded processes.

                            <p>JavaScript is increasingly being used to create games like Angry Birds, Polycraft and Bejewelled. When used with HTML5, JavaScript can create powerful games that require nothing more than a keyboard to play. 
                            The combination opens up a range of different engines, libraries and variations of common web languages that can be used to create fully-fledged, interactive games.</p>

                            <p>One of the most powerful things you can do with JavaScript is build applications for non-web contexts. That’s a fancy way of saying you can make apps for things that aren’t the internet. For instance, mobile devices are now the most popular way to access the internet. What this means is that ALL of your websites should be responsive (but that could be another blog post). Additionally, it means that mobile applications are as important a product as a web property for digital goods. The catch is that mobile apps come in two major flavors, Apple and Android</p>

                Even the mobile phone we are using now is a work of JavaScript... which helps us to interact with our phone... with JavaScript ... alot of hardworks can be reduced by adding a functionality to something and make works look easier. The cars we use: has some JavaScript embended in it.. this helps controlling technological intrument,object easier .. eg. is <b>Tv remote</b> .</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is said to be the most popular programing language.. and over 97% of website that has been created was done using javascript. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
